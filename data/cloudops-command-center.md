# CloudOps Command Center

CloudOps Command Center is a platform engineering assistant that turns infrastructure signals into explainable, owner-routed, approval-gated remediation workflows.

It brings risk detection, raw evidence, service ownership, deterministic Decision Traces, runbooks, human approvals, controlled execution, and audit history into one operational workspace.

## Project Overview

The overview below summarizes the investigation experience, system architecture, five-step Decision Trace, safety boundary, and core technology stack.

## Problem It Solves

Cloud and platform teams receive signals from GitHub Actions, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and monitoring systems. Seeing an alert is only the beginning. Engineers still need to determine:

- What is risky and why does it matter?
- Which service and environment are affected?
- What evidence supports the recommendation?
- Who owns the service?
- What must be verified before remediation?
- Is human approval required?
- Can the decision and resulting action be audited later?

CloudOps Command Center connects those questions into one controlled workflow.

## Core Workflow

```text
Infrastructure signal
        ↓
Validation and risk mapping
        ↓
Raw evidence + service ownership
        ↓
Deterministic Decision Trace
        ↓
Engineer verification
        ↓
Human approval boundary
        ↓
Controlled remediation
        ↓
Audit and execution history
```

## Decision Trace

Each supported risk can include an auditable Decision Trace with five typed steps:

```text
Premise → Reasoning → Hypothesis → Verification → Conclusion
```

Every step has a stable ID, explicit dependencies, and a confidence value bounded between `0` and `1`. The premise cites supplied evidence, the hypothesis remains conditional, the verification step names what an engineer must check, and the conclusion preserves the approval boundary.

This is a deterministic application artifact—not hidden chain-of-thought. It uses structured evidence and fixed templates, does not require MCP or an LLM, and cannot authorize or execute infrastructure changes.

PlatformPilot risks continue to enforce:

```text
approvalRequired: true
status: needs_approval
executionMode: manual
```

## Investigation Workspace

![Decision Trace investigation workspace](docs/dashboard-risk-inbox.png)

The investigation workspace separates overview work from detailed analysis:

- The left-hand queue supports search plus severity and source filters.
- Selecting a risk opens its service, owner, source, confidence, and execution metadata.
- Raw evidence is preserved separately from interpretation.
- The trace shows how each reviewable step depends on earlier evidence.
- Approval controls remain outside the trace itself.

### Complete Decision Trace

![Complete Decision Trace and approval boundary](docs/decision-trace-investigation.png)

This view shows the complete five-step trace. Confidence decreases as the trace moves from source observations toward a hypothesis and conclusion, reflecting increasing uncertainty. The final panel makes the operational boundary explicit: no infrastructure change runs from the trace, and a human must review the evidence before remediation.

### Architectural responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Signal sources | Supply workflow, cloud, cluster, plan, and monitoring observations. |
| Ingestion APIs | Accept supported inputs without granting execution authority. |
| Validation and authentication | Reject malformed or unauthorized PlatformPilot findings before storage. |
| Risk engine | Normalizes signals into categorized, owner-routed infrastructure risks. |
| Decision Trace engine | Produces deterministic, evidence-backed steps with bounded confidence and dependencies. |
| Repository | Uses Postgres when configured and an in-memory demo fallback for local development. |
| Investigation workspace | Presents the queue, raw evidence, trace, recommendation, and approval boundary. |
| Human-controlled operations | Requires verification and approval before runbook-based remediation. |
| Audit history | Records scans, approvals, dismissals, and executed remediation events. |

## Features

- Searchable risk inbox with severity, source, status, service, owner, and confidence context
- Deterministic Decision Traces over PlatformPilot findings and demo risks
- Raw evidence preserved separately from hypotheses and conclusions
- Owner routing and service catalog
- Approval queue and permission-aware controls
- Runbooks with safety checks and rollback plans
- GitHub Actions workflow-failure import
- Terraform plan JSON risk detection
- PlatformPilot contract validation and authenticated ingestion
- Structured JSON operational telemetry with request correlation IDs
- Execution and audit history
- Responsive investigation workspace

## Operational Telemetry

API operations emit structured JSON events for key ingestion and remediation decisions.

Each event includes:

- a request correlation ID
- route and event name
- outcome and HTTP status
- risk or finding context when available
- requested and current status where relevant
- actor role and rejection or blocking reason

Supported upstream `x-request-id` values are preserved and returned in API responses. When one is not supplied, CloudOps Command Center generates a request ID for correlation.

This runtime telemetry complements the persisted audit and execution history rather than replacing it.
