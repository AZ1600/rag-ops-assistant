# Platform Engineering Observability

[![Validate Observability Configuration](https://github.com/AZ1600/platform-engineering-observability/actions/workflows/validate-observability.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AZ1600/platform-engineering-observability/actions/workflows/validate-observability.yml)

A reproducible observability engineering lab built with **Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Loki, Tempo, Alertmanager, FastAPI, Docker, and Docker Compose**.

The project demonstrates the complete operational path from application telemetry to dashboards, distributed tracing, centralized logging, alerting, SLO monitoring, error-budget burn-rate detection, CI validation, and external Slack notifications.

# Observability Signals

The platform covers the three core telemetry signals:

```text
Metrics
Logs
Traces
```

and extends them with:

```text
Alerting
SLIs
SLOs
Error Budgets
Burn Rates
External Notifications
```

---

# RED Application Monitoring

The main application dashboard follows the RED method:

```text
R = Rate
E = Errors
D = Duration
```

The dashboard includes:

- Request Rate
- HTTP 5xx Error Rate
- P50 Latency
- P95 Latency
- P99 Latency
- Request Rate by Route
- Request Rate by Status Code
- Average Latency by Route
- Error Rate by Route

The dashboard is provisioned from:

```text
grafana/dashboards/demo-api-red.json
```

![Grafana Demo API RED Dashboard](docs/screenshots/grafana-demo-api-red-dashboard.png)

The test application contains intentional `/slow` and `/error` endpoints, allowing the dashboard to demonstrate real changes in latency and failure rate.

---

# Application Metrics

Prometheus scrapes the FastAPI application from:

```text
/metrics
```

Application monitoring uses metrics including:

```text
http_requests_total
http_request_duration_seconds
http_request_duration_highr_seconds
```

The `/metrics` endpoint is excluded from application traffic calculations so Prometheus scrape traffic does not distort RED measurements.

---

# Distributed Tracing

FastAPI is instrumented with OpenTelemetry.

The trace pipeline is:

```text
FastAPI
   ↓
OpenTelemetry SDK
   ↓
OpenTelemetry Collector
   ↓
Grafana Tempo
   ↓
Grafana
```

The `/work` endpoint produces nested spans:

```text
GET /work
└── perform-demo-work
    └── database-simulation
```

![Grafana Tempo Work Trace](docs/screenshots/grafana-tempo-work-trace.png)

This provides visibility beyond HTTP duration and shows where time was spent inside the application.

---

# Structured Logging

The application writes structured JSON logs containing fields such as:

```text
timestamp
level
service
message
route
status_code
trace_id
span_id
duration_seconds
error_type
```

Example:

```json
{
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "demo-api",
  "message": "intentional application failure",
  "trace_id": "6a2a28b377efabd3b5c4ccc3314467e9",
  "span_id": "58ee7634418ccfab",
  "route": "/error",
  "status_code": 500,
  "error_type": "observability_test"
}
```

The log pipeline is:

```text
FastAPI
   ↓
Structured JSON
   ↓
OpenTelemetry Collector
   ↓
Grafana Loki
   ↓
Grafana
```

---

# Log-to-Trace Correlation

Application logs contain the active OpenTelemetry:

```text
trace_id
span_id
```

Grafana uses the trace ID as a derived field.

This creates the investigation path:

```text
Loki log
   ↓
TraceID
   ↓
View Trace
   ↓
Tempo
   ↓
Matching distributed trace
```

![Grafana Loki Trace Correlation](docs/screenshots/grafana-loki-trace-correlation.png)

This allows an operator to move directly from an error log to the trace for the same request.

---

# Application Alerting

Prometheus evaluates application-level alert rules from:

```text
prometheus/rules/application.yml
```

Current application alerts include:

```text
DemoApiHigh5xxErrorRate
DemoApiHighP95Latency
```

## High 5xx Error Rate

Condition:

```text
HTTP 5xx error rate > 10%
for at least 1 minute
```

## High P95 Latency

Condition:

```text
P95 latency > 1 second
for at least 1 minute
```

The alert lifecycle is:

```text
Application behaviour
        ↓
Prometheus metrics
        ↓
Alert rule
        ↓
PENDING
        ↓
FIRING
        ↓
Alertmanager
```

---

# Slack Alert Notifications

Alertmanager routes warning and critical alerts to Slack.

```text
Prometheus
     ↓
Alertmanager
     ↓
Severity routing
     ↓
Slack
```

The Slack integration was validated with a real application failure.

The notification demonstrated both:

```text
FIRING
RESOLVED
```

states.

![Slack Application Alert Firing and Resolved](docs/screenshots/slack-application-alert-firing-resolved.png)

This confirms the complete operational lifecycle:

```text
/error traffic
      ↓
5xx rate increases
      ↓
Prometheus alert fires
      ↓
Alertmanager
      ↓
Slack FIRING notification
      ↓
Application recovers
      ↓
Slack RESOLVED notification
```

---

# Slack Secret Management

The Slack webhook is **not committed to Git**.

Locally it is stored in:

```text
.secrets/slack_webhook_url
```

The directory is excluded by:

```gitignore
.secrets/
```

Docker Compose mounts the file into Alertmanager as:

```text
/run/secrets/slack_webhook_url
```

Alertmanager references the webhook using:

```yaml
api_url_file: /run/secrets/slack_webhook_url
```

This keeps the real webhook outside version-controlled configuration.

GitHub Actions creates a harmless placeholder secret file only for configuration validation.

---

# SLIs and SLOs

The project defines two reliability objectives.

## Availability

```text
Availability SLO = 99%
```

The availability SLI measures:

```text
Successful non-5xx requests
          /
All application requests
```

Recording rule:

```text
demo_api:sli_availability_ratio:5m
```

---

## Latency

```text
Latency SLO = 95%
```

The latency SLI measures:

```text
Requests completed within 1 second
                /
Total application requests
```

Recording rule:

```text
demo_api:sli_latency_under_1s_ratio:5m
```

---

# Error Budgets

The SLOs define how much failure is acceptable.

For availability:

```text
99% SLO
→ 1% failure budget
```

For latency:

```text
95% SLO
→ 5% slow-request budget
```

Prometheus records:

```text
demo_api:error_budget_availability_remaining:5m
demo_api:error_budget_latency_remaining:5m
```

Values are constrained between:

```text
0% and 100%
```

---

# SLO Burn-Rate Alerting

The project also monitors how quickly the service consumes its available error budget.

Burn rate compares the observed failure rate with the amount of failure allowed by the SLO.

```text
Burn Rate
=
Observed bad-event rate
/
Allowed bad-event rate
```

A burn rate of:

```text
1x
```

means the service is consuming its error budget at exactly the sustainable rate.

Higher values indicate increasingly rapid budget consumption.

## Availability Burn Rate

The availability SLO is:

```text
99%
```

which permits:

```text
1% failed requests
```

For example:

```text
50% failures
÷
1% allowed failures
=
50x burn rate
```

## Latency Burn Rate

The latency SLO requires:

```text
95% of requests complete within 1 second
```

which permits:

```text
5% slow requests
```

For example:

```text
50% slow requests
÷
5% allowed
=
10x burn rate
```

## Multi-Window Detection

Prometheus records burn rate over multiple windows:

```text
1 minute
5 minutes
15 minutes
```

The rules are stored in:

```text
prometheus/rules/burn-rate.yml
```

### Fast Burn

Fast-burn alerts require both short windows to exceed:

```text
4x
```

the sustainable error-budget consumption rate.

```text
1m burn rate > 4
AND
5m burn rate > 4
```

These alerts are classified as:

```text
severity = critical
```

Current fast-burn alerts:

```text
DemoApiAvailabilityFastBurn
DemoApiLatencyFastBurn
```

### Slow Burn

Slow-burn alerts detect lower but sustained error-budget consumption.

```text
5m burn rate > 1
AND
15m burn rate > 1
```

These alerts are classified as:

```text
severity = warning
```

Current slow-burn alerts:

```text
DemoApiAvailabilitySlowBurn
DemoApiLatencySlowBurn
```

## Slack Burn-Rate Notifications

Burn-rate alerts use the existing Alertmanager-to-Slack notification pipeline.

```text
Application degradation
        ↓
SLI falls below objective
        ↓
Error budget consumption
        ↓
Burn-rate calculation
        ↓
Fast / Slow burn alert
        ↓
Alertmanager
        ↓
Slack
```

Validation produced both fast-burn and slow-burn alerts.

Fast-burn alerts demonstrated:

```text
FIRING
RESOLVED
```

and sustained degradation caused both slow-burn alerts to reach:

```text
FIRING
```

![Slack Burn Rate Alerts](docs/screenshots/slack-burn-rate-alerts.png)

This demonstrates alerting based not only on instantaneous thresholds, but also on the rate at which reliability budget is being consumed.

---

# No-Traffic Handling

No application traffic is not treated as a service failure.

The SLI rules only emit values when application traffic exists.

```text
No requests
    ↓
No new SLI sample
```

This prevents an idle application from incorrectly appearing as:

```text
0% available
```

---

# SLO and Error Budget Dashboard

Grafana provisions:

```text
Demo API SLO & Error Budget
```

from:

```text
grafana/dashboards/demo-api-slo.json
```

The dashboard shows:

- Availability SLI
- Availability SLO
- Availability Error Budget Remaining
- Latency SLI
- Latency SLO
- Latency Error Budget Remaining
- Availability SLI vs SLO
- Latency SLI vs SLO
- Error Budget Remaining

![Grafana SLO Error Budget](docs/screenshots/grafana-slo-error-budget.png)

A deliberate failure test produced:

```text
Availability SLI = 50%
Availability SLO = 99%

Latency SLI      = 50%
Latency SLO      = 95%

Error budgets    = 0%
```

The short five-minute measurement windows are intentional for local lab validation.

Production SLO implementations would normally use significantly longer rolling windows.

---

# Infrastructure Monitoring

Node Exporter provides host-level metrics including:

- CPU
- memory
- filesystems
- operating system statistics

Prometheus also monitors target health.

The infrastructure alert:

```text
TargetDown
```

fires when a monitored target remains unavailable for one minute.

---

# Demo Application

The FastAPI application exists specifically to generate predictable telemetry.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Basic application response |
| `GET /health` | Health check |
| `GET /work` | Normal request with nested spans |
| `GET /slow` | Intentional high-latency request |
| `GET /error` | Intentional HTTP 500 failure |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus metrics |

---

# Failure Testing

The lab deliberately generates abnormal behaviour.

## Application Failure

```text
GET /error
      ↓
HTTP 500
      ↓
Prometheus metrics
      ↓
RED dashboard
      ↓
ERROR log
      ↓
Loki
      ↓
Tempo trace
      ↓
Availability SLI impact
      ↓
Prometheus alert
      ↓
Alertmanager
      ↓
Slack
```

## Application Latency

```text
GET /slow
      ↓
~2 second response
      ↓
Latency histogram
      ↓
P95 / P99 increase
      ↓
WARNING log
      ↓
Tempo trace
      ↓
Latency SLI impact
      ↓
Latency alert
```

---

# GitHub Actions Validation

The repository contains:

```text
.github/workflows/validate-observability.yml
```

The workflow runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`.

It automatically validates:

```text
Docker Compose configuration
FastAPI Docker image build
Python application syntax
Prometheus configuration
Prometheus alert rules
Prometheus SLI/SLO recording rules
Prometheus burn-rate rules
Alertmanager configuration
Grafana dashboard JSON
```

The CI pipeline is:

```text
Pull Request
     ↓
Checkout
     ↓
Create CI secret fixtures
     ↓
Docker Compose validation
     ↓
Application image build
     ↓
Python validation
     ↓
Prometheus validation
     ↓
Alertmanager validation
     ↓
Grafana JSON validation
```

This moves configuration validation out of a purely manual workflow and into version-controlled CI.

# Current Limitations

This is intentionally a local observability engineering lab.

Current limitations include:

- single demo application
- short lab-oriented SLI/SLO measurement windows
- local Loki storage
- local Tempo storage
- no high availability
- no production object storage
- no production retention strategy
- no Kubernetes deployment
- local monitoring interfaces do not use authentication

---

# Future Extensions

The core observability and reliability engineering scope of this lab is complete.

Potential future extensions include:

```text
Longer production-style SLO windows
Kubernetes deployment
Highly available telemetry storage
Production retention policies
Authentication for monitoring interfaces
Persistent object storage for Loki and Tempo
```

The current implementation already demonstrates the complete path from application telemetry through reliability monitoring and external incident notification.
